# UberApp
This is a simulation program of an Uber application, in which, when starting to run the program, the first message that appear us is to log in, we must write the username (Passenger1) and password (password123) correctly, otherwise, if it is typed wrong 4 times, a message will appear saying "Too many attempts", and the program will close.
If the username and password are correct, the program will show us a menu of options in which we can do different things:
Option 1 will allow us to make a trip at the current time, when selected it will ask us for trip information, and it will calculate the cost of the trip according to the options that were chosen, this information will be saved in a history, which will be a text file, and which in option 2, will allow us to show.
Option 3 is like option 1, the difference is that option 2 allows us to schedule a future trip, adding the date on which trip will be, and option 4 will show us the information of the reserved trip adding the missing days starting from the current date.
Option 5 will allow us to rate drivers, we can choose the driver we want to rate, writing the number of stars from 1 to 5, and save this information in another text file, which option 6 will allow us to show.
Option 7 will show us information that is stored in text files, which is information of available vehicles and drivers.
If we want to suggest adding new vehicles, option 8 will allow us to write the vehicle that we want to be added to the application, and option 9 will allow us to view them.
Finally, option 10 will be to exit the program.
